            <h2 id="headline">Fun facts about Gudetama</h2>
            <ul><p><b>Gudetama means Lazy Egg </b>: The name Gudetama comes from the Japanese phrase, “gude gude” グデグデ which means lazy, and “tamago'' たまご which means egg. So its name translates to English as lazy egg ぐでたま.</p></ul>
            <ul><p><b>Gudetama Has No Gender </b>: According to Gudetama’s designer, the character is an unfertilized egg. Therefore it has no gender. That’s so progressive!</p></ul>
            <ul><p><b>Gudetama takes on a few forms </b>: Being an egg (a heavily used ingredient in Japanese cuisine) our anthropomorphic eggo friendo takes on many different forms. Better yet, their mood changes with each form they turn into. For example, being cracked into a steaming cup of ramen, you can see their inexpressive happiness from poaching in the hot broth.

            In other situations, they may be a hard-boiled egg soaking in broth, relaxing, not wanting to be picked up by a hungry customer. </p></ul>
            <ul><p><b>Gudetama Represents Depression and Apathy </b>: The designer AMY has stated that the design of Gudetama was inspired by an egg she was cooking. The way the yolk slowly ran out of its shell and simply laid there reminded her of the way young people feel today—often tired and lazy towards life. Thus, Gudetama is constantly being lazy and lacking in energy to do anything.</p></ul>
            <ul><p><b>Gudetama is Considered “Kimo-Kawaii” </b>: The Sanrio characters are well known for their kawaii cute appearance but Gudetama isn’t seen as traditionally cute. Instead, Gudetama is known as kimo-kawaii which roughly translates as grotesque cuteness. The appeal of Gudetama is more in the relatability of its depressed and lazy manner. </p></ul>
